# SOIL HEALTH & FOOD SECURITY: How Our Analysis Addresses Both Core Themes

## 🌱 **THE SOIL HEALTH DIMENSION**

### **What Soil Health Means in Our Analysis**

Soil health represents the foundation of agricultural productivity and climate resilience. Our analysis addresses soil health through **4 key indicators**:

#### **1. Soil pH (Acidity/Alkalinity)**
- **What it measures**: Soil acidity affects nutrient availability to crops
- **Our data**: Mean pH values across 4,149 sub-regions
- **Critical insights**:
  - **Acidic soils (pH < 5.5)**: Common in West/Central Africa, limits crop growth
  - **Alkaline soils (pH > 8.5)**: Found in arid regions (Sahel), causes nutrient lockup
  - **Example**: Nigeria's Borno state shows pH 7.37 (alkaline stress) in drought-prone areas

#### **2. Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)**
- **What it measures**: Soil fertility and carbon storage capacity
- **Our data**: SOC content (g/kg) indicating soil fertility
- **Critical insights**:
  - **Low SOC (< 10 g/kg)**: Degraded soils in Sahel region (Niger, Chad)
  - **High SOC (> 30 g/kg)**: Fertile soils in highland Ethiopia, forest zones
  - **Example**: Niger's Tillaberi region shows SOC 3.3 g/kg = severe degradation

#### **3. Soil Texture (Sand/Clay Balance)**
- **What it measures**: Water retention and workability of soils
- **Our data**: Sand and clay percentages affecting agricultural potential
- **Critical insights**:
  - **Sandy soils (>70% sand)**: Poor water retention in Nigeria's northern states
  - **Heavy clay (>60% clay)**: Waterlogging issues in river delta regions
  - **Optimal balance**: 40-60% sand provides best agricultural conditions

#### **4. Environmental Vulnerability Score**
- **What it measures**: Combined soil degradation index (0-3 scale)
- **Our calculation**: Weighted combination of pH stress + SOC depletion + texture constraints
- **Critical insights**:
  - **Score > 2.0**: Severely degraded soils requiring intensive restoration
  - **Score 1.0-2.0**: Moderately degraded, manageable with intervention
  - **Score < 1.0**: Healthy soils, focus on conservation

## 🌾 **THE FOOD SECURITY DIMENSION**

### **What Food Security Means in Our Analysis**

Food security represents the agricultural productivity and economic stability threatened by climate-soil interactions. Our analysis addresses food security through **3 key metrics**:

#### **1. Value of Production (VOP) - Agricultural Economics**
- **What it measures**: Annual economic value of crop production (USD)
- **Our data**: $23.7B total agricultural value at risk across high-risk areas
- **Critical insights**:
  - **Nigeria**: $8.9B agricultural economy threatened by climate-soil degradation
  - **Ghana**: $6.5B in cocoa/crop production at risk from soil acidity + drought
  - **Ethiopia**: $5.0B highland agriculture vulnerable to erosion + water stress

#### **2. Population Exposure - Human Food Security**
- **What it measures**: Number of people dependent on at-risk agricultural systems
- **Our data**: 213+ million people living in high climate-soil risk areas
- **Critical insights**:
  - **Rural dependence**: 80% of population in high-risk areas depends on agriculture
  - **Smallholder focus**: Average farm size 2-5 hectares, highly vulnerable to soil degradation
  - **Food access**: Degraded soils → lower yields → higher food prices → hunger

#### **3. Geographic Food System Vulnerabilities**
- **What it measures**: Spatial patterns of food system risk
- **Our data**: 1,037 sub-regions mapped for agricultural vulnerability
- **Critical insights**:
  - **Sahel food corridor**: Millet/sorghum production threatened by soil + drought
  - **Forest-savanna transition**: Maize/cassava systems facing soil acidity
  - **Highland agriculture**: Coffee/cereals vulnerable to erosion + climate change

## 🔗 **THE SOIL HEALTH ↔ FOOD SECURITY CONNECTION**

### **How Soil Degradation Directly Threatens Food Security**

Our analysis reveals **4 critical pathways** where soil health problems create food security crises:

#### **Pathway 1: Acidic Soils → Crop Failure → Hunger**
```
Low soil pH → Aluminum toxicity → Root damage → Crop yields drop 30-70% → Food shortages
```
- **Example**: Ghana's forest zone - soil pH 4.2 prevents cocoa/food crop production
- **Impact**: 45% yield reduction in maize, primary food staple

#### **Pathway 2: Carbon-Depleted Soils → Poor Fertility → Malnutrition**
```
Low SOC → Poor nutrient retention → Crops lack nitrogen/phosphorus → Malnutrition
```
- **Example**: Niger's croplands - SOC 3.3 g/kg can't support adequate grain protein
- **Impact**: Stunting affects 43% of children under 5

#### **Pathway 3: Poor Soil Structure → Water Stress → Crop Loss**
```
Sandy soils → Poor water retention → Drought vulnerability → Complete harvest failure
```
- **Example**: Northern Nigeria - 70% sand content amplifies drought impact
- **Impact**: Farmers lose entire seasons, families face acute food insecurity

#### **Pathway 4: Soil Erosion → Land Loss → Displacement**
```
Degraded soils → Erosion → Lost farmland → Rural-urban migration → Urban food insecurity
```
- **Example**: Ethiopia's highlands losing 2-5 cm topsoil annually
- **Impact**: 2M people migrating to cities, increasing urban food vulnerability
